Hello, my name is **Lisa and I am a biologist**. I studied in a city that looks like this:

![Uppsala](https://www.svenskbyggtidning.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/magasinering-uppsala-11.jpg)

which is one of the biggest cities in a country with this flag:
![Sweden](https://flagman.ie/flags/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sweden-Flag-600x360.png)



A famous botanist that was professor in that city ,**Carl Nilsson Linnæus** , once said
>“_If a tree dies, plant another in its place_.”

I really recommend the program that I studied there. You can find it here: [I am not a virus](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/program/?pKod=MIB2M)
